Investment Calculator App!

This application takes an initial investment and calculates the annual return.  It was originally part of a Udemy course as an independent assignment.  I love how it focuses on the basics of React, and my next steps are to add unit tests, to refactor, and continue developing this fun little application as I grow my React skills.
